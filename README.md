# Security Strike Toolkit

This security strike toolkit is an attemp to provide information about secure
digital communication, data verification and protection in a friendly manner.

This was motivated by the need to have verifible information and secure
communications when organizing a strike. Both of this are needed to be able to
have security for the people organizing it and the people sharing information
in digital media about it.

We give this information in an attemp to provide self security when you are in
the risk to be retaliated (not because what you do in the strike is illegal, but
because it is inconvenient for someone with power) and to make easier to appeal
to instances specialized in prosecuting human rights violations (let say local,
country and international courts).

**DISCLARIMER:** we are **not security experts** and this information must
be taken just as areference to have what we hope is the minimal information
about this subjects. If you think you could be in a risk bigger (may say a
nation-state, crime organization is prosecuting your cause) **DO NOT** follow
this information, appeal to more specialized instalnces for advices.
